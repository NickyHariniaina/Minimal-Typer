# Minimal typer.

## Introduction.

This is a minimal typing test. Using __HTML, CSS and JS__.

## How to use it.

### Setting up the project.

First Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://NickyHariniaina/Minimal-Typer.git
```

Go the cloned directory.

```bash
cd Minimal-Typer
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Open it using the live server extension on __VSCode__.

### Setting up the game.

Before playing the game, you'll be redirected to the *settings page*, you'll choose your game mode.

#### ColorScheme.

After that you can choose a __color scheme__ in the *appearance page*.

*We recommend you to use the Linen color scheme for better visual experience*.

Just press a button to directly see the colorscheme applied in all the game.

**See the shortcuts section to see how to quit the settings part without pressing the quit button***

### Playing.

You'll have a board  where you'll see all the text. 

**Warning**: If you press on a key that occurs to be a letters or a numbers([a-zA-Z0-9]), the test will directly begin. 

At the end of the test, the stat will be shown in full screen. (I think that there is no need to add a documentation for it because it is very clear in the game.).

## Shortcuts.
+ `<Esc>` : quit the settings page.
+ `Enter`: Start a new game.
+ `Backspace`: quit the score page.
